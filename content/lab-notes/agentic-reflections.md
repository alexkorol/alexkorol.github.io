## Morning tuning

Experimented with staggered activation windows to curb runaway consensus. A 90-second delay between mediator prompts softened oscillations without muting dissenting voices.

## Afternoon sandbox

Swapped the evaluator's rubric from cosine similarity to sentence-level entailment via DeBERTa. The richer signal re-ranked fringe proposals and surfaced genuinely novel tactics.

## Evening notes

Queued a follow-up batch with a temperature sweep (0.3â€“1.1). Expecting higher variance to tease apart whether the entailment scoring is overly stabilizing the cohort.
